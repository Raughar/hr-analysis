# HR Analysis

### Project Description:
This is my final project for the Ironhack Data Analytics Bootcamp. My aim is to study a dataset of Human Resources information to predict the attrition on employees and research what are the situations that causes it. To do that, first, I will create a notebook using Python to analyze and understand the data and then, process it to search for the best models to predict it.

Then, I will use Tableau to delve deeper in the data and create a dashboard so the company management and the HR department can look at those insights and apply informed decissions on the future of the company.

I will also create a Streamlit app to predict the attrition of an employee, you can acces it here: [Streamlit App Repo](https://github.com/Raughar/hr-analysis-streamlit)

### Project Objectives:
The aim of the project is to get insights into the attrition of employees and the factors that affect it. To get the best results, I have prepared the following questions:

- What's the age of employees with attrition?
- How many years have the employees with attrition worked for the company?
- Combining the two: Does attrition affect more junior or senior employees?
- What's the monthly income of the employees with attrition?
- Which department does have more attrition?
- Which role has the most employees with attrition?

Answering those questions, will give us more information into what actions to take to prevent attrition on the new employees and try to fix it with current employees.

The creation of a predictive model will also help to create a program to track the employee attrition from their start in the company and prevent it.
