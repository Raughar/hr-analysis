# HR Analysis

### Project Description:
This is my final project for the Ironhack Data Analytics Bootcamp. My aim is to study a dataset of Human Resources information to predict the attritio on employees and research what are the situations that causes it. To do that, first, I will create a notebook using Python to analyze and understand the data and then, process it to search for the best models for the task and train them.

Then, I will use Tableau to delve deeper in the data and create a dashboard so the company management and the HR department can look at those insights and apply informed decissions on the future of the company.

Last, I will try and create an Streamlit app, so management can acces the dashboard at any time from any computer using their browsers.
